# PyWeek 34

My entry for PyWeek 3

The Python Space Program is going to Mars! Of course, it's still too dangerous to send humans there until a habitable station is setup on it's surface. So the lab went and pumped out a solution. 100 tiny little clones, perfectly suited for survival on the surface of Mars! Just one *small* problem. They're all idiots. And the budget just ran out...

Have fun keeping them alive!
